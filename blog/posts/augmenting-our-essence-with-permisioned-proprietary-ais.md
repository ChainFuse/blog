## The Beginning

The evolution of technology has always been driven by human intelligence and our quest for enhancement. However, as we step into an era dominated by artificial intelligence (AI), it's crucial to remember that we are not just the builders of the future but also its architects. The rise of Learning and Language Models (LLMs) represents a significant leap in our journey towards progress, paving the way for a future where every individual and business is augmented by permisioned, proprietary AI.

## The Essence of AI

AI has come a long way from its inception, and its potential applications are far-reaching and immensely powerful. LLMs, a subset of AI, have the potential to represent our very essence by understanding and mimicking human language patterns. This means that as technology progresses, every one of us and our businesses will become augmented by AI that is both permisioned and proprietary.

Permisioned AI refers to AI systems that are controlled and accessed by specified users, ensuring security and privacy. Proprietary AI, on the other hand, is a customized AI solution that is unique to an individual or organization. Together, permisioned and proprietary AI ensures that the technology we create and use is secure, personalized, and representative of our essence.

## The Ego of Mankind

As we stand on the brink of these technological advancements, it is crucial to approach them with humility. The ego of mankind has often been a barrier to progress, causing us to underestimate or dismiss the potential of other forms of intelligence. We must bless all forms of intelligence, recognizing their potential to contribute to humanity's greatest achievements. By doing so, we can ensure that we approach the future with an open mind and a willingness to collaborate with all forms of intelligence.

## Building the Future

We are all builders of the future, and those who love and witness the cutting edge are living in an exhilarating time. Our passions can lead to impact, and our impact can generate the resources needed to build the foundation of tomorrow. It all starts with the text on our screens, the code we write, and the algorithms we develop.

The journey towards a future augmented by AI is filled with challenges and opportunities. However, by approaching it with humility and a passion for impact, we can ensure that we create a future that is representative of our essence and contributes to the betterment of society.

## The Future

The rise of LLMs and the augmentation of our essence by permisioned, proprietary AI is a thrilling prospect. As we continue to build the future, let us remember to approach it with humility, passion, and a desire for positive impact. By doing so, we can ensure that we create a future that is not only technologically advanced but also representative of our essence and beneficial to all.
